Bulk-artefact-uploader is based off the work done by Chris Watts that I came across at:

   http://www.devgrok.com/2012/01/bulk-upload-of-maven-artifacts-to.html

I have taken his code and made some changes to it and am publishing it via GitHub.

* Requirements
  - Handle command line options for
    + extensions
    + classifiers
    + mvn-bin
    + mvn-opts (by default use MVN_OPTS)
    + mvn-home (by default use MAVEN_HOME or M2_HOME)
    + repo-url
    + repo-id
  - Handle snapshots and releases repositories
  - Handle versions that are of the form fubar-4.1.0-freesdk.jar in which '-freesdk' is part of the version
  - Turn this into a proper command line executable
