Bulk-artefact-uploader is based off the work done by Chris Watts that I came across at:

   http://www.devgrok.com/2012/01/bulk-upload-of-maven-artifacts-to.html

I have taken his code and made some changes to it and am publishing it via GitHub.

** TODO
   - Handle command line options
     + Options for handling 
     ++ extensions
     ++ classifiers
   - Handle snapshots and releases repositories
   - Handle versions that are of the form fubar-4.1.0-freesdk.jar in which '-freesdk' is part of the version
   - Turn this into a proper command line executable
